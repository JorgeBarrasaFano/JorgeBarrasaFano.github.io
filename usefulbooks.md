A plethora of useful books, videos, and online resources are freely available all over the internet, and I list here the ones I found very awesome and essential-to-know for everyone interested in Scientific Computing. I will try to keep this list up-to-date with the materials I face every day, most of which published by open source and open knowledge community.

## Numerical Methods

* [Introduction to Numerical Methods for Variational Problems](https://hplgit.github.io/fem-book/doc/web/index.html): If you think you know Finite Element, have a look at this book to know that you don't. A step-by-step guide to understand the mathematical underlying of Finite Element.

* [Finite Difference Computing with PDEs - A Modern Software Approach](https://hplgit.github.io/fdm-book/doc/web/index.html): A book to renew your previous knowledge of Finite Difference Method.

* [Programming for Computations - A Gentle Introduction to Numerical Simulations with Python or MATLAB/Octave](https://hplgit.github.io/prog4comp/index.html): Two separate guides to implement numerical algorithms in Python and GNU Octave/MATLAB.

* [Practical Numerical Methods with Python](https://github.com/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc): A great Jupyter-based course to explore practical numerical methods with Python.

* [Wolfgang Bangerth's Video Lectures](https://www.math.colostate.edu//~bangerth/videos.html): A set of useful videos in which an expert numerical scientist talks about different aspects of scientific computing in details but in a simple way.

* [Introduction to Numerical Methods for Engineers](https://www.youtube.com/user/kvyi/playlists): A large number of introductory videos to learn the basics of numerical methods (linear algebra, curve fitting, numerical integration and differentiation, etc.).

## Computational Engineering

* [CFD Python, 12 Steps to Navier-Stokes](https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython): A practical set of Jupyter notebooks and videos to understanding the foundations of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).

* [Introduction to Computational Science and Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF706B428FB7BD52C): A comprehensive course to obtain a deep insight into Computational Engineering. Although it is relatively long and time-consuming to watch, but you might be interested in some specific topics ([lecture list](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-085-computational-science-and-engineering-i-fall-2008/video-lectures/)).

## Programming Languages

* [A Very Basic Intro to Scientific Python](http://hplgit.github.io/bumpy/doc/web/index.html): Includes two short booklets on the overview of Python 2 syntax and a physics example implemented in Python. 

* [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, Learning with Python 3](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e): A great book to learn every aspect of Python programming language.

* [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, C++ Version](http://greenteapress.com/thinkcpp/index.html): An easy-to-understand book to start learning C++ from scratch.

## Computer Science

* [Think OS, A Brief Introduction to Operating Systems](http://greenteapress.com/thinkos/): The simplest text I've ever found to describe how operating systems work.

## Machine Learning

* [Mastering Machine Learning with Python in Six Steps](https://github.com/mbarzegary/mastering-ml-w-python-in-six-steps): A collection of Jupyter notebooks to jump-start learning the basics of Machine Learning.

* [Introduction to Linear Algebra for Applied Machine Learning with Python](https://pabloinsente.github.io/intro-linear-algebra): The best  applied introduction to the basics of linear algebra in Python I've ever seen.
