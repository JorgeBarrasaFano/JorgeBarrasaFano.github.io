title: What I Use
---

As some scenes from a memory, I just remember that so many years ago, there was a section named "What I Use" in my favorite technology website of Paul Thurrott, in which he kept a list of software programs, apps, and gadgets that he used regularly in his personal and professional life. Indeed, that list was so beneficial for me to know a wide range of available software programs to satisfy the needs of my everyday activities at work and home.

Here,  I will try to keep an up-to-date list of software programs that I heavily use every day without any problem in both of my professional activities including Scientific Computing as well as Machine Learning as a Ph.D. researcher and the personal usage of my laptop as an ordinary user. In fact, this list demonstrates a set of freely available software packages that everyone (such as a student, scientist, developer, etc.) can take advantage of in his/her work-day and regular activities. I have excluded the runtimes and frameworks (such as CUDA, JVM, and GCC) as well as general tools (such as Docker and Git) because they are problem-specific and are available on a variety of platforms based on the user's requirements.
