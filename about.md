Hello there! My name is Mojtaba Barzegari, and I'm an enthusiastic computational engineering PhD researcher, doing research on scientific computing, high-performance computing, and computational biomedical engineering, with a solid background in software development. Let's say, I love to use computers to solve real-world problems. 

I am working at the Biomechanics section, KU Leuven, Belgium, and am interested in being involved in multidisciplinary projects related to my research background and experiences including the fields of mathematics, physics, computer science, engineering, chemistry, medical and biological sciences, and materials science. 

Prior to my current career, I received my BSc and MSc in materials science and biomedical engineering, respectively. Both my BSc and MSc theses were based on the combination of numerical analysis and computational intelligence. I have also worked on some Machine Learning and data analysis projects in the field of medicine, biology, industrial automation, and Internet of Things (IoT). Please refer to [Research Portfolio](/research) for more information on my research experiences. 

Moreover, I have been building software for more than 16 years (since 2003) and have been involved in a wide range of software development projects, from IoT to large-scale enterprise applications. I am a big fan of open-source software development model, and especially in the field of scientific computing, I'm an open source and open science advocate (for an example of this, you may have a look at the <a target="_blank" href="http://tuxriders.com/">TuxRiders</a> project).

To further review what I've done till now, you may have a look at my [extended CV](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mbarzegary/MyCV/blob/master/main.pdf). The source code of my CV is available on GitHub (just for fun, the corresponding repository uses Continuous Integration techniques to produce the final output), so have a look on the [repository](https://github.com/mbarzegary/MyCV) if you want to have your own.

Outside of my research, I always love to spend my time playing music (on bass and electric guitar) and diving into the world of music theory. I also enjoy challenging myself on playing chess with people around the world on chess.com and lichess.org. Last but not least, I always enjoy talking with people and knowing their opinion on different things, from the most abstract topics to daily-life ones.
