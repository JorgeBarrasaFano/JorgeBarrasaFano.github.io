title: About Me

Hello there! My name is Mojtaba Barzegari, and I'm an enthusiastic computational engineering PostDoc researcher, doing research on scientific computing, high-performance computing, and computational biomedical engineering, with a solid background in software development. Let's say, I love to use computers to solve real-world problems. I like to be involved in multidisciplinary projects related to my research background and experiences including the fields of mathematics, physics, computer science, engineering, chemistry, medical and biological sciences, and materials science. 

I am working at the Membrane Materials and Processes group, Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), the Netherlands, where I am focused on modeling electrochemical processes of energy storage systems. Prior to my current career, I was a PhD researcher at KU Leuven, Belgium, where I worked on high-performance computational modeling of tissue engineering processes. I received my BSc and MSc in materials science and biomedical engineering, respectively. Both my BSc and MSc theses were based on the combination of numerical analysis and computational intelligence. I have also worked on some Machine Learning and data analysis projects in the field of medicine, biology, industrial automation, and Internet of Things (IoT). Please refer to [Research Portfolio](/research) for more information on my research experiences. 

Moreover, I have been building software for more than 19 years (since 2003) and have been involved in a wide range of software development projects, from IoT to large-scale enterprise applications. I am a big fan of the open-source software development model, and especially in the field of scientific computing, I am an open-source and open science advocate (for an example of which you may have a look at the <a target="_blank" href="http://tuxriders.com/">TuxRiders</a> project).

To further review what I've done till now, you may have a look at my [CV](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mbarzegary/MyCV-shortened/blob/main/main.pdf). The source code of the CV is available on GitHub, so you may have a look at [this repository](https://github.com/mbarzegary/MyCV-shortened) if you want to have your own (an outdated less-compact version is available [here](https://github.com/mbarzegary/MyCV)).

Outside of my research, I always love to spend my time playing music (on bass and electric guitar) and diving into the world of music theory. I also enjoy challenging myself on playing chess with people around the world on chess.com and lichess.org. Last but not least, I always enjoy talking with people and knowing their opinion on different things, from the most abstract topics to daily-life ones.
