My name is Mojtaba Barzegari. I'm an enthusiastic Computational Engineering researcher in the field of Biomedical Engineering with a solid background in software development. Let's say, I love to use computers to solve real-world problems. 

I am working in the Biomechanics section of KU Leuven, mainly involved in Scientific Computing projects. I'm interested in multidisciplinary projects mostly related to my research background and field of interest including Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Engineering, Chemistry, Medical and Biological Sciences, and Materials Science. Please refer to [Research Portfolio](/research) for more information. 

Prior to my current career, I received my BSc and MSc in Materials Science and Biomedical Engineering, respectively. Both my B.Sc. and M.Sc. theses were based on the combination of Numerical Analysis, Scientific Computing, and Computational Intelligence. I have also worked on some Machine Learning and Data Analysis projects in the field of Medicine, Biology, Industrial Automation, and Internet of Things (IoT).

Moreover, I have been building software for more than 16 years (since 2003) and have been involved in a wide range of software development projects, from IoT to large-scale enterprise applications.

To further review what I've done till now, you may have a look at my [CV](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mbarzegary/MyCV/blob/master/main.pdf). The source code of my CV is available on GitHub (just for fun, the corresponding repository uses Continuous Integration techniques to produce the final output), so have a look on the [repository](https://github.com/mbarzegary/MyCV) if you want to have your own.
